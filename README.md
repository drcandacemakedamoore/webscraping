# webscraping

This is a notebook that shows you how to webscrape multiple pages. If you wanted to use the outcomes for anything here, arguably, you would need to credit over 1000 authors of the individual entries you are scraping. Just because you can do something, does not mean you should. Webscraping is used for many nefarious reasons. On the other hand, it might one day help us end infectious disease and the 'infodemics'they create faster.
